PARTLY_RELEVANT,"While the answer provides steps on how to access the course schedule, it also includes additional information like registering for the course and joining a Telegram channel. The mention of the course start date and time is relevant but the answer could be more focused on just providing the course schedule information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing the link for course registration. It is clear and to the point, making it relevant to the inquiry."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides relevant information on how to receive course announcements by subscribing to the course public Google Calendar, registering before the course starts, joining the course Telegram channel, and registering in DataTalks.Club's Slack. However, it includes additional steps like joining a Telegram channel and Slack, which may not be directly related to receiving course announcements."
RELEVANT,The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing clear instructions on how to join the Slack channel for the course. It is relevant and provides the necessary information to the user.
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing a specific location where the prerequisites for the course can be found, which is the GitHub repository named DataTalksClub data-engineering-zoomcamp#prerequisites. This answer is considered relevant as it directly guides the user to the information they are seeking."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing a clear and specific step on how to check the prerequisites for the course. It mentions visiting a specific GitHub repository and looking for the prerequisites section, which is highly relevant to the question asked."
RELEVANT,The generated answer clearly and directly addresses the question by specifying that the course prerequisites are listed in the GitHub repository DataTalksClub data-engineering-zoomcamp under the section titled #prerequisites. This information is relevant and provides a specific location for where the course prerequisites can be found.
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The answer provides information about where to find the prerequisites for joining the course, which is helpful. However, it does not directly answer the specific requirements for joining the course, leading to a partly relevant classification."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing a specific location, the GitHub repository 'DataTalksClub data-engineering-zoomcamp', where the list of prerequisites for the course can be found. This makes the answer highly relevant to the question asked."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The answer provides some relevant information about enrolling in the course after it starts and mentions that it is possible. However, it also introduces additional information about submitting homework and deadlines for final projects, which are not directly related to the question asked."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not directly address the question of whether late registration is possible. Instead, it provides information about the registration process for the Data Engineering Bootcamp. Therefore, it is considered non-relevant to the given question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by stating that late submissions are not allowed, but also provides information on how to submit homework after the due date if the form is still open. It would be more relevant if it directly answered whether joining late affects homework submission eligibility."

However, it does not directly address the question of whether all assignments can be submitted at the end of the course if one starts late."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not provide any information related to when the confirmation email will be received after registering for the Data Engineering Bootcamp. Instead, it focuses on the process of registration and the ability to start learning without waiting for a confirmation email. Therefore, it is not relevant to the question asked."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The answer addresses the question by clarifying that the confirmation email is not needed to start the Data Engineering Bootcamp. However, it also provides additional information about the registration process and homework submission, which is not directly related to the question asked. Thus, the answer is partially relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The answer provided is partly relevant as it correctly states that registration is required to participate in the Data Engineering Bootcamp. However, it does not specifically address whether you can begin learning and submitting homework without registering, which was the main focus of the question. It would be more relevant if it directly answered the question with a simple yes or no."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information by stating that registration is not mandatory to start the course. However, it also goes further to mention that registration is just to gauge interest before the start date, which is not directly addressing the question about whether registration is necessary to begin the course."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information about the purpose of registering for the Data Engineering Bootcamp, which is to gauge interest before the start date. However, it deviates from the question by stating that registration is not mandatory and you can start learning and submitting homework without registering, which is not directly addressing the purpose of registering when it is not mandatory."
