- `Inference` -  Using a trained model to generate output (as opposed to training the model).
- `Transforming` - use Large Language Models for text transformation tasks such as language translation, spelling and grammar checking, tone adjustment, and format conversion.
- `Temperature` - The degree randomness of prediction
```
temperature = 0 -> for tasks that require reliability, predictability  
 meaning the out put is the same everytime.

temperature = 0.3 or higher like temprature = 0.7 -> for tasks that require variety 
 The out put is different everytime.

So Temprature can be set to different values depending what you want to accomplish. 
```
