    "\n",
    "Vector search leverages machine learning (ML) to capture the meaning and context of unstructured data, including text and images, transforming it into a numeric representation. Frequently used for semantic search, vector search finds similar data using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms. Compared to traditional keyword search, vector search yields more relevant results and executes faster.\n",
